# 10xLabs definition analysis

For documentation purposes all examples are captured using semi-Ruby DSL (not expected to be working during analysis phase). DSL is compiled to JSON for storage by microcloud. 

Definition itself can be represented in any meaningful way (JSON, XML, other DSLs).
Available labs:

* `lab1-10xeng` - lab definition as used for 10xEngineer, describing VMs only
* `lab2-10xeng` - extended lab1 with definition of custom components
* `lab2-simpleapp` - simple web application scenario
